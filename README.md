# math
I will upload all the math projects I make here, while studying for my Mathematics And Computing degree.

# Differential Equation Plotter
This is a program I made using sympy; An Open Source Computer Algebra System (to parse inputs), Numpy and Matplotlib, to plot direction fields of first order differential equations using by plotting isoclines of the ODE.

### Further Improvements
1. Extending it to Second Order or nth ODEs.
2. Plotting a integral curve from a point using scipy.
3. Making a GUI for input and support for changing constants by adding a slider like we have in desmos.
